How well did your interface work?
    Our interface did not work very well
Did it recognize your facial expressions with the same accuracy as it achieved against the test set?
    No, we got a 0% accuracy on facial expressions other than neutral. It thought every emotion was neutral
If not, why not?
    Maybe the model needs better training, doesn't recognize the features on my face. I saw in the discord
    some students were having similar issues with accuracy in the TicTacToe game.


Currently a problem with sizing the image.
