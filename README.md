Emotional TicTacToe

Create a deep learning neural network with Keras and Tensorflow in Python. Using a facial expression dataset from Kaggle I used these images as samples to train the initial
neural net for facial expression classification. 

Challenges: Learning deep learning, neural networks, Keras, tensorflow.
Learned: A general idea of how deep learning training works, how to play tictactoe with emotions.
